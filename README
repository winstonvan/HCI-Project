Goup J - HCI Project
Sudbury Restaurant Search Website

The following website is run by opening 'HCI-Project/Project/index.html'
Best viewed in 1920, 1080 window resolution.

*NOTE: all information was taken from other websites about restaurants around Sudbury

The folders in Project are required for functionality of the website (images/css/js)

The 'Contact Me' and 'View portfolio' buttons were designed but not implemented as we had no information to provide.
    
We had originally designed the 'Website' link when viewing the restaurant information for redirecting to the restuarants website, however since not all restaurants had websites, we redirected it back to our original instead.
